## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

This website is part of a portfolio project for my Website Development course. While it serves as a class assignment, it’s also intended to be a real-world-ready portfolio site for my partner. As the project progresses, I plan to refactor code, improve accessibility, and potentially add JavaScript-based features.
