            <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Consumer Behavior & Marketplace Studies and Communication Arts with a Digital Studies Certificate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My academic journey has endowed me with a deep understanding of market dynamics and effective communication strategies.</p>
            <p>In addition to my studies, I serve as a Peer Advisor at the Morgridge Center for Public Service and a Peer Navigator for the Center for Educational Opportunities. These roles have allowed me to engage deeply with the community, offering guidance and support to fellow students while fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about helping others and improving systems to create more efficient and effective pathways for success. I am actively seeking a Human Resources or Marketing internship to gain hands-on experience in the field. My goal is to use my skills and passion to contribute meaningfully to an organization that values innovation and continuous improvement in human resource management.</p>
